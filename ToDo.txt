Allow behaviour to subscribe to events like: 
 	- AgentFixedUpdate, 
 	- AgentLateUpdate,
 	- AgentTriggerEnter
 	- AgentTriggerStay
 	- AgentTriggerExit
 	- BehaviourFixedUpdate, 
 	- BehaviourLateUpdate,
 	- BehaviourTriggerEnter
 	- BehaviourTriggerStay
 	- BehaviourTriggerExit
Where Agent____ events are called with agent regardless of behaviour is enabled or not, and Behaviour____ events are called only when Behaviour is enabled.
Behaviour should only subscribe to those event which are overwritten by user. To achieve this, Create a scriptable object that stores the data related to which Behaviour class overrides which methods. This data should be updated whenever the scripts are reloaded.

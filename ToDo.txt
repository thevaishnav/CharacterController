Allow ability to subscribe to events like: 
 	- PlayerFixedUpdate, 
 	- PlayerLateUpdate,
 	- PlayerTriggerEnter
 	- PlayerTriggerStay
 	- PlayerTriggerExit
 	- AbilityFixedUpdate, 
 	- AbilityLateUpdate,
 	- AbilityTriggerEnter
 	- AbilityTriggerStay
 	- AbilityTriggerExit
Where Player____ events are called regardless of ability is enabled or not, and Ability____ events are called only when ability is enabled.
Ability should only subscribe to those event which are overwritten by user. To achieve this, Create a scriptable object that stores the data related to which ability class overrides which methods. This data should be updated whenever the scripts are reloaded. 
=======================================================
In JumpAbility, Move logic to apply persistant force from AbilityUpdate to AbilityFixedUpdate so that becomes frame rate independant.

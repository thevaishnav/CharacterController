# Script Structure
The core scripts are written in different layers. Each subfolders in the "./Scripts" folder represent 1 layer. 
These layers are constructed in a way that the layer numbered 'n' is dependant on all layers with number <n.


This is a Submodule of my Resources Repository (Private) and therefore, it might be missing some dependencies.
